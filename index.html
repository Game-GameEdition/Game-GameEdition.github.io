                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a first-year student studying Computer Science at Oregon State University Cascades. 
                    My professional aspiration is to become a full-time software engineer, especially one working to 
                    implement AI in cybersecurity applications, but on a personal level, I believe that I will be 
                    satisfied with any job that allows me to meaningfully learn, create, and collaborate every single day. My personal hobbies include 
                    judo, learning guitar, and reading. Current book of interest: Python Crash Course by Eric Mathes.

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    I was a co-lead for the programming sub-team for my high-schools FRC robotics club, 
                    collaborating with other programmers to develop functional Java code and deploy it 
                    to a competition-ready robot. (Seasonal: Nov-March, 2021-2024)

                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    Communication: For example, on my robotics team, when the robot needed a feature, 
                    every sub-team's leaders were asked for their opinion. This meant that the basic 
                    principle of “two minds are better than one” was always taken advantage of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Open-minded: Since our robotics team was very small, I frequently needed to work 
                    on software one day and then hardware the next, meaning I had to be open to learn new 
                    skills and adapt to what the team as a whole needed.
